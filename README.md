## Piranavan's way to set up project locally:
1. Clone Repository onto your device
2. Open up Command Line Terminal
3. "cd" into the path containing the repo you cloned
4. Run "python -m venv venv" (you will need to have the latest version of Python downloaded)
5. Run "activate"
6. Run “python -m pip install -r requirements.txt”
7. Run “set FLASK_APP=main”
8. Run “set FLASK_ENVIRONMENT=development”
9. Run “set FLASK_DEBUG=1”
10. Run "code ." (this will open up the repository in the coding IDE you chose)
11. Run "flask run"
12. Visit the URL specified in your terminal after running the command above
